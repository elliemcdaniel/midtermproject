# Midterm Project
My GIS programming midterm project is using available ACLED conflict index data. ACLED ranks violent conflict levels across the world. I am creating a web map of violent conflict data that can also be updated by users. Due to constraints with data size in AGOL, only data from Somalia is currently available for viewing on the map.
